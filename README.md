## Getting Started

If you prefer videos that guide you through the setup process you can find them [here](https://github.com/strapi/nextjs-corporate-starter/issues/71)

1. Clone the repository locally:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lucas-issayama/bnbreizh.git
    or
  gh repo clone lucas-issayama/bnbreizh
```

2. Run `setup` command to setup frontend and backend dependencies:

```bash
  yarn setup
```

3. Next, navigate to your `/backend` directory and set up your `.env` file. You can use the `.env.example` file as reference:

```bash
HOST=localhost
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS="toBeModified1,toBeModified2"
API_TOKEN_SALT=tobemodified
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=tobemodified
JWT_SECRET=tobemodified
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT=tobemodified
```

4. Start your project by running the following command:

```bash
  yarn build
  yarn develop
```

You will be prompted to create your first admin user.

Great. You now have your project running. Let's add some data.

## Setting Up The Frontend

Next we need to switch to our `/frontend` directory and create our `.env` file and paste in the following.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your-public-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAGE_LIMIT=6
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_FORM_SUBMISSION_TOKEN=your-form-submission-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://localhost:1337
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=mapbox-token
```

Before starting our Next JS app we need to go inside our Strapi Admin and create two tokens that we will be using for **form submission** and displaying our **content**.

Inside your Strapi Admin Panel navigate to Settings -> API Tokens and click on the `Create new API Token`.

![api-tokens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6153188/231865572-cebc5538-374c-4050-91cd-c303fae25a3d.png)

Here are our Token Settings

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN

Name: Public
Description: Public.
Token duration: Unlimited
Token type: Read-Only

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_FORM_SUBMISSION_TOKEN

Name: Public API Form Submit
Description: Form Submission.
Token duration: Unlimited
Token type: Custom

In Permissions lets give the following access.

| Content              | Permissions |
| -------------------- | :---------: |
| Lead-Form-Submission |   create    |

Add your tokens to your `.env` file.

Once your environment variables are set you can start your frontend application by running `yarn dev`.

You should now see your Next JS frontend.

## Start Both Projects Concurrently

We can also start both projects with one command using the `concurrently` package.

You can find the setting inside the `package.json` file inside the root folder.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "frontend": "yarn dev --prefix ../frontend/",
    "backend": "yarn dev --prefix ../backend/",
    "clear": "cd frontend && rm -rf .next && rm -rf cache",
    "setup:frontend": "cd frontend && yarn",
    "setup:backend": "cd backend && yarn",
    "setup": "yarn install && yarn setup:frontend && yarn setup:backend",
    "dev": "yarn clear && concurrently \"cd frontend && yarn dev\" \"cd backend && yarn develop\""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "concurrently": "^7.6.0"
  }
}
```

Go to the root folder and install the package, `yarn`
You can start both apps by running `yarn dev`.
